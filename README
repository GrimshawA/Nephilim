Nephilim Engine SDK
Version: 0.8
License: zlib
Author: Artur Moreira (artturmoreira@gmail.com)

This library is designed to make games using C++ and AngelScript and to publish to Desktop(PC/Linux/Mac/Browsers) and to Mobile(iOS/Android) platforms.

You are free to use the library for any purpose without any costs. Credits to the original author and library are appreciated but are not mandatory.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to compile and run games made with this engine, you need to link against its libraries. I provide a few pre-compiled libraries you can use.
If there are no libraries for the platform you want to run, you will have to compile the engine and its dependencies yourself.
